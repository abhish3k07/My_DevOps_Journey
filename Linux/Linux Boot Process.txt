Power on - The POST (power-on self-test) performs a series of checks to ensure that the hardware is functioning properly.
BIOS - The BIOS initializes the hardware and searches for a boot device.
MBR - The MBR is read from the boot device, and contains the bootloader.
Bootloader - The bootloader, such as GRUB, loads the Linux kernel.
Kernel - The kernel is responsible for managing system resources and providing services to other processes.
Init - The init process is responsible for starting all other user-space processes and services.
Services and daemons - The appropriate services and daemons are started, based on the runlevel specified in the /etc/inittab file.
