In Linux, a process is a running instance of a program. Every process has a unique process ID (PID) that identifies it. Linux uses a process-centric model, which means that everything in the system is a process. Even the kernel itself is a process.

Whenever a command is issued in Unix/Linux, it creates/starts a new process. For example, pwd when issued which is used to list the current directory location the user is in, a process starts.
Through a 5 digit ID number Unix/Linux keeps an account of the processes, this number is called process ID or PID. Each process in the system has a unique PID.
Used up pidâ€™s can be used in again for a newer process since all the possible combinations are used.
At any point of time, no two processes with the same pid exist in the system because it is the pid that Unix uses to track each process.
