In today's fast-paced world, continuous learning is more important than ever. As an aspiring DevOps engineer, I believe that public learning is a powerful way to deepen our knowledge and understanding, and to help others who are on a similar journey.
That's why I'm excited to announce that I'll be sharing my DevOps learning journey on this platform. Starting from the very basics, I'll be documenting my progress as I learn new skills and technologies. My hope is that by sharing my experiences, I can help others who are just starting out in the field or who want to deepen their understanding.
But public learning isn't just about helping others - it's also about helping ourselves. By sharing what we learn with others, we solidify our own understanding and gain new perspectives on the topics we're studying. It's a win-win situation.
So if you're interested in DevOps, I invite you to join me on this journey. Let's learn, share, and grow together!
